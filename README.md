# WIP

This is a sample project that demonstrates testing with XCUITest, using a basic Page Object Model structure, with multiple helper and utility methods that I've created or used during my work with XCUITest  
You'll also find multiple examples of things you can do with XCUITest out of the box and different ways of locating elements  
Of course I am currently working on this so more stuff will be added
