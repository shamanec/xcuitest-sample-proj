# XCUITest sample project

This is a sample project that demonstrates testing with XCUITest, using a basic Page Object Model structure, with multiple helper and utility methods that I've created or used during my work with XCUITest  
It serves more as a demonstration of XCUITest than POM which is just a simple example for structuring tests without any coding bells and whistles.

## Highlights
### Interaction helper methods
Can be found in the `Helpers/Interaction` class
1. [pressHomeButton](xcuitest-sample-projUITests/Helpers/Interaction.swift#pressHomeButton)
2. [performGentleSwipe](xcuitest-sample-projUITests/Helpers/Interaction.swift#pressHomeButton)

## Target app
The tests target a sample app I've built using Google and ChatGPT because I am not an app developer, but its sufficient for demonstration
